Windows software to map large sets of GPS data such as tracks and waypoints, displayed in a summarized style rarely found in other software.

Release planned for Summer 2016.

Practical applications for visualization:
- personal travel records
- drone flight logs
- scientific research
- business/sales
- real estate
- government/regulatory
- law enforcement
- criminal investigation
- search/rescue
- military
- political campaigns
- energy utilities and exploration

Some domains would require minor straightforward implementation.  Anything is possible, given a source of sample data, or file, and a documented specification/standard, better yet already coded in C#.

OpenStreetMaps will be displayed, as they are free.   Some popular alternative maps require licensing, yet they are feasible for the future. 

The display may vary with dimensions of interest, such as date/time or any given property of each point.  Color, shade, and hiding/filtering will help answer questions about these variables.

Named after the medieval Persian scientist Abū Rayḥān Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad Al-Bīrūnī.  Almost 1000 years ago, he accurately measured the Earth and tabulated coordinates of hundreds of locations.
